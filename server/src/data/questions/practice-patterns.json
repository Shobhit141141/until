No. Standard: V = V? Yes. Take 'I' from VI, move to right. V = I + I? No. Actually: V = I is false. Move one: V - I = IV? No. How about: Move I from left to right? V = I + I? No. Move match from V to make it /? No. Simple: Make it 'V - I' (Remove vertical from plus? There is no plus). Ah. VI = I. Move I from left to right? No. Change to 'V - I = IV'? Too many moves. Correct: Remove 'I' from VI, place it over the = to make 'not equal'? (Cheating). Better: VI - I = V? No. How about V = V? Take I, put it... where? Discard? Usually 'Move' implies placement. Okay, standard riddle: V = 1. Move one? Make square root? Let's use simple arithmetic: '5 + 5 = 550' (Draw line on + to make 4). Question text replacement: 5+5+5=550."
