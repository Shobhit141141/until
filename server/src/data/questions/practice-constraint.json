Let's re-eval. 'A is not a knight' -> True if A is Liar. So B (Liar) telling True is impossible. Problem: B says 'A is not Knight' means B says 'A is Liar'. If B is Liar, then 'A is Liar' is false -> A is Knight. If A is Knight, 'B is Knight' is True. So A=K, B=K. But prompt says 'One Knight, One Liar'. Answer is Impossible. I will change prompt for valid logic. 'A says: We are both liars'. A cannot be Knight (would lie). So A is Liar. Statement is False -> Not 'Both Liars'. Since A is Liar, B must be Knight. Valid. Option: A Liar, B Knight."
