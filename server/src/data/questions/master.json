'Noon' is the only one where the first and last letters are the same Case in standard print? No. Actually, 'Level' -> 'leveL'. 'Noon' -> 'nooN'. 'Madam' -> 'madaM'. If written as 'Level', it's not a palindrome. If written as 'noon' (lowercase) it is. I will assume standard string equality. 'Race car' fails length/space.
