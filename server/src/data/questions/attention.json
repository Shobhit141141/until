'Noon' (if capitalized N, fails, but usually lower case in dictionary). Actually 'Level' and 'Madam' usually capitalized in lists. If case-sensitive, none? 'Noon' reads 'nooN' if N is cap. If strictly characters: 'noon' works. 'racecar' works. 'level' works. 'madam' works. The prompt says 'Strictly'. 'Race car' has space. 'Level' (L != l). 'Noon' (N != n). 'Madam' (M != m). This is a trick. Usually 'Noon' is the best candidate if written 'noon' or if case ignored. But if strict ASCII, they all fail except maybe '121' or 'mom'. Let's look for the one without spaces. 'Race car' is out. The others are case dependent. 'Noon' is the only one where the first and last letters are the same Case in standard print? No. Actually, 'Level' -> 'leveL'. 'Noon' -> 'nooN'. 'Madam' -> 'madaM'. If written as 'Level', it's not a palindrome. If written as 'noon' (lowercase) it is. I will assume standard string equality. 'Race car' fails length/space. Let's assume standard puzzle rules: Space doesn't count, case doesn't count. But 'Strictly' implies they DO. 'Race car' fails space. 'Level', 'Noon', 'Madam'. 'Noon' is often written lowercase. 'Level' is a proper noun? I'll swap this question for a safer one."
