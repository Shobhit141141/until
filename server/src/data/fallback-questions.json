A,C,D are true (3). So we need exactly two true; only B and E are false, so A,C,D are true—three. So B and E is the only pair that are both false; the two true would be from A,C,D. So 'B and E' means the pair that are false; the question asks which pair can be the true pair. So we need a pair of true statements. A and C are both true; that gives two true. So answer A and C."},

Move 1 kg from right to left: left 4, right 0. Move 1 kg to right: left 3, right 1+1=2. No. Move 1 kg to right: left 3 kg, right 1+1=2 kg. Still 3≠2. So move 3 kg to right: left 0, right 1+3=4. No. Correct: move 1 kg to right gives left 3, right 2—no. Actually move 1 kg to the right pan: left 3, right 1+1=2. We need 3=2+? So we need to add 1 to right: move 1 kg from left to right. Then left 2, right 2. So move 1 kg to right."},

A false so prize not in A. So prize in C. But then only B true. So prize in C. If A true: prize in A; then B false (prize in A so B's 'not here' is false for B); C false (B is not lying). So A only true. So prize in A. Two possibilities. If C true: B is lying. B says prize not here (B). So B lying means prize is in B. Then A false, so prize not in A. So prize in B. So we get A true→prize A; B true→prize C; C true→prize B. Question says only one label true. So we need one consistent. If prize in B: B says 'not here' false, C says 'B is lying' true, A says 'here' false. So C only true. Prize in B. So answer B (prize in box B)."},

Then two true. So (3) cannot be only true. If (2) true: (1) false, (3) false. (3) false means (2) not false, contradiction. If (1) true: (2) and (3) false. (2) false: (1) not false so (1) true, ok. (3) false: (2) not false so (2) true, so (1) false. Contradiction. So only (3) can be true alone: (3) true ⇒ (2) false ⇒ (1) true. So (1) and (3) both true. So no.
